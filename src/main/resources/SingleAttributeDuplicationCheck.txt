# Configuration for running the SingleAttributeDuplicationCheck to list
# instances not having a value duplicated in the configured attributes.
# For example, a member should not be used twice in the hasMember slot
# of EntitySet. There is one line per class with tab-separated tokens.
# The first token is the class name. The remaining tokens are the
# attributes. Each attribute is checked separately.
#
# DatabaseObject.modified is the predominant issue reported. It is disabled since
# the duplicate is generated programmatically and is not correctible by a curator.
